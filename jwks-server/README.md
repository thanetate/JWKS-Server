# JWKS Server

## Objective
This project implements a basic JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server that:
- Provides public keys with unique identifiers (`kid`) for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
- Implements key expiry for enhanced security.
- Includes an authentication endpoint to issue JWTs.
- Handles the issuance of JWTs signed with expired keys based on a query parameter.

This project is for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, youâ€™d want to integrate with a proper authentication system and ensure security best practices.

---

## Features
- **Key Rotation**: Automatically generates new RSA key pairs at regular intervals and removes expired keys.
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Serves public keys in JWKS format for verifying JWTs.
- **Auth Endpoint**: Issues JWTs signed with valid keys and supports issuing tokens with expired keys.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes for invalid requests.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - Flask
  - cryptography
  - PyJWT
  - pytest (for testing)

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jwks-server

2. Create a VM

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Start the server:

    python3 run.py

2. The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:8080
3. Test the endpoints using curl or Postman

## Endpoints
1. /jwks (GET)

    Description - Returns the public keys in JWKS format.
    Example - curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/jwks

    Response - 
    {
    "keys": [
        {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "kid": "unique-key-id",
        "use": "sig",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "n": "base64-modulus",
        "e": "base64-exponent"
        }
    ]
    }
2. /auth (POST)

    Description - Issues a JWT signed with a valid key. Supports issuing tokens with expired keys using the expired query parameter.
    Parameters - expired (optional): true or false. Default is false. 
    Example - curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth

    Response -
    {
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6..."
    }

## Testing
1. Run the test suite

    pytest --cov=app

2. Ensure test coverage is over 80%

## Example Workflow
1. Start the Server

    python3 run.py

2. Generate a valid JWT

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth

3. Verify the JWT using the public key from /jwks

4. Request a JWT signed with an expired key

    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth?expired=true"

## Notes
    The kid in the JWT header matches the kid in the JWKS response, allowing verifiers to identify the correct public key.

    This server is for educational purposes and should not be used in production without additional security measures.
